# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
Drivers often feel very drowsy while continuously driving for long distances without taking breaks. Drowsiness is a major factor in increasing the chances for a vehicle to meet accidents. According to various studies, Number of accidents caused by drowsiness is much higher than the number of accidents caused by drunk driving. The number of accidents caused by drowsiness can be reduced by having a proper system that can detect drowsiness, alert the driver and prevent major injuries. It needs a proper system that will alert drivers to prevent major injuries. The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents i have build a drowsiness detection system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy. In this system the driver assistance System is presented in order to reduce the number of accidents caused by driver fatigue and thus improve road safety. This system treats the automatic detection of driver drowsiness based on visual information and transfer learning. We locate, track and analyse the driver face and eyes and check whether the driver is drowsy or not.

I have taken the MRL Eyes dataset to train my model.
